# Ecosystem Renderers

Community and third-party A2UI renderer implementations.

!!! note
    These renderers are maintained by their respective authors, not the A2UI team.
    Check each project for compatibility, version support, and maintenance status.

!!! tip
    Looking for the **official** React renderer? See [`@a2ui/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@a2ui/react) — the core A2UI React renderer maintained by the A2UI team.

### Notable Mentions

These projects are early-stage or experimental:

- **[xpert-ai/a2ui-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xpert-ai/a2ui-react)** (`@xpert-ai/a2ui-react`) — React renderer with ShadCN UI components (v0.0.1, published Jan 2026)
- **[josh-english-2k18/a2ui-3d-renderer](https://github.com/josh-english-2k18/a2ui-3d-renderer)** — Experimental Three.js/WebGL 3D renderer for A2UI (~2 stars)
- **[AINative-Studio/ai-kit-a2ui](https://github.com/AINative-Studio/ai-kit-a2ui)** — React + ShadCN renderer for the AIKit framework (~2 stars)

### Related Projects

These projects are not A2UI renderers but are relevant to the generative UI space:

| Project | Platform | Description | Links |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------|
| **vercel-labs/json-render** (`@json-render/*`) | React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, React Native | Generative UI framework by Vercel — uses its own JSON schema (not A2UI protocol) with Zod-based component catalogs. Supports streaming, 36 pre-built shadcn/ui components, and cross-platform rendering. | [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel-labs/json-render) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@json-render/core) · [Docs](https://json-render.dev/) |

### Highlights

**easyops-cn/a2ui-sdk** (`@a2ui-sdk/react`) is the most fully-featured community React renderer, with 11 published versions, Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS styling, and a dedicated docs site. It was [announced on the A2UI discussions](https://github.com/google/A2UI/discussions/489). For the official React renderer, see [`@a2ui/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@a2ui/react).

**lmee/A2UI-Android** fills an important gap — it's the only community Jetpack Compose renderer, covering Android 5.0+ with 20+ components, data binding, and accessibility support.

**sivamrudram-eng/a2ui-react-native** is the only React Native renderer, enabling A2UI on iOS and Android via a single codebase.

**BBC6BAE9/a2ui-swiftui** is a native SwiftUI renderer supporting iOS, macOS, visionOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It covers all 18 standard A2UI components with dual v0.8 + v0.9 protocol support, includes JSONL streaming, and uses the Observation framework for reactivity.

### Python / PyPI

No credible A2UI renderer packages were found on PyPI as of March 2026. A2UI renderers are client-side (UI) libraries, so the ecosystem is naturally focused on JavaScript/TypeScript and native mobile frameworks.

## Submitting a Renderer

Built an A2UI renderer? We'd love to list it here.

### How to submit

1. **Fork** the [google/A2UI](https://github.com/google/A2UI) repository
2. **Edit** this file (`docs/ecosystem/renderers.md`) — add a row to the Community Renderers table with your renderer's name, platform, npm package (if any), version support, and a link to the source
3. **Open a PR** against `google/A2UI` with a short description of your renderer
4. **Post in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/google/A2UI/discussions)** — let the community know what you built! A short demo video goes a long way.

Need inspiration? Browse the **[community samples](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/samples)** in the repo — these cover Angular, Lit, and ADK-based agents and are a good starting point.

### What makes a good community renderer?

A listing is more likely to be accepted and used if it:

- Has **published source code** (open-source preferred, MIT or Apache 2.0)
- Clearly states **which A2UI spec version** it supports (v0.8, v0.9, or both)
- Covers **core components**: text, buttons, inputs, and basic layout
- Includes a **README** with install instructions and a minimal usage example
- Is **actively maintained** — flag it as archived if you're no longer supporting it

Community renderers don't need to be production-ready to be listed — experimental and early-stage projects are welcome in the Notable Mentions section.
