# How Does A2UI Compare?

The agentic UI space is evolving rapidly. Here's how A2UI relates to the other major approaches.

## A2UI vs MCP Apps

[MCP Apps](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2025-11-21-mcp-apps/) treat UI as a **resource** — servers provide pre-built HTML via `ui://` URIs, rendered in sandboxed iframes. The remote integration controls all content and appearance, with configuration happening through tool calling. A2UI takes a **declarative UI** approach — agents send component blueprints, but the host application controls styling, theming, and how those components are configured and rendered. Choose MCP Apps when the server should own the full UI experience; choose A2UI when you want dynamic, cross-platform UI that fits naturally into your app.

## A2UI vs AG UI / CopilotKit

[AG UI](https://ag-ui.com/) is a **transport protocol** connecting agent backends to frontends with real-time state sync. A2UI is a **UI format** — the payload that describes what to render. They're complementary: use AG UI as the pipe, A2UI as the content. AG UI is a project by the [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai) team, who have also contributed the A2UI React renderer and the [A2UI Composer](../composer.md). AG UI has day-zero A2UI compatibility.

## A2UI vs ChatKit (OpenAI)

[ChatKit](https://openai.com) offers a tightly integrated experience within the OpenAI ecosystem. A2UI shares some design philosophy with ChatKit — both define a set of basic components and use a configurable, declarative abstraction layer. A2UI is **platform-agnostic** — designed for developers building their own agentic surfaces across web, mobile, and desktop, or for multi-agent systems where agents need to render UI across trust boundaries.

## Using Them Together

These approaches are complementary, not competing:

- **A2UI + AG UI** — AG UI as transport, A2UI as the generative UI format
- **A2UI + A2A** — A2UI messages sent via the [A2A protocol](../concepts/transports.md) for multi-agent systems
- **A2UI + MCP** — Upcoming bridge lets MCP servers provide A2UI blueprints alongside HTML resources
