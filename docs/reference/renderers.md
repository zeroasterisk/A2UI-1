# Renderers (Client Libraries)

Renderers convert A2UI JSON messages into native UI components for different platforms.

The [agents](agents.md) are responsible for generating the A2UI messages,
and the [transports](../concepts/transports.md) are responsible for delivering the messages to the client.
The client renderer library must buffer and handle A2UI messages, implement the A2UI lifecycle, and render surfaces (widgets).

You have a lot of flexibility, to bring custom components to a renderer, or build your own renderer to support your UI component framework.

## Maintained Renderers

| Renderer | Platform | v0.8 | v0.9 | Links |
|----------|----------|------|------|-------|
| **React** | Web | ✅ Stable | ❌ | Coming soon |
| **Lit (Web Components)** | Web | ✅ Stable | ✅ Stable | [Code](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/renderers/lit) |
| **Angular** | Web | ✅ Stable | ✅ Stable | [Code](https://github.com/google/A2UI/tree/main/renderers/angular) |
| **Flutter (GenUI SDK)** | Mobile/Desktop/Web | ✅ Stable | ✅ Stable | [Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai/genui) · [Code](https://github.com/flutter/genui) |
| **SwiftUI** | iOS/macOS | — | 🚧 Planned Q2 | — |
| **Jetpack Compose** | Android | — | 🚧 Planned Q2 | — |

## Ecosystem Renderers

The community is building A2UI renderers for additional platforms:

- **[json-render](https://json-render.dev/docs/a2ui)** — Vercel's React library for rendering A2UI catalogs via Zod schemas ([comparison](https://dipjyotimetia.medium.com/vercels-json-render-vs-google-s-a2ui-the-head-to-head-6f213cf1a23b))
- **[A2UI-Android](https://github.com/lmee/A2UI-Android)** — Community Jetpack Compose renderer, 20+ components (~15 ⭐, v0.8)
- **[a2ui-react-native](https://github.com/sivamrudram-eng/a2ui-react-native)** — React Native renderer for iOS/Android (~9 ⭐, v0.8)

See the **[full ecosystem renderers list](../ecosystem/renderers.md)** for more community projects and how to submit your own.

## How Renderers Work

```
A2UI JSON → Renderer → Native Components → Your App
```

1. **Receive** A2UI messages from the transport
2. **Parse** the JSON and validate against the schema
3. **Render** using platform-native components
4. **Style** according to your app's theme

## Using a Renderer

Get started integrating A2UI into your application by following the setup guide for your chosen renderer:

- **[Lit (Web Components)](../guides/client-setup.md#web-components-lit)**
- **[Angular](../guides/client-setup.md#angular)**
- **[Flutter (GenUI SDK)](../guides/client-setup.md#flutter-genui-sdk)**

## Building a Renderer

Want to build a renderer for your platform?

- See the [Roadmap](../roadmap.md) for planned frameworks.
- Review existing renderers for patterns.
- Check out our [Renderer Development Guide](../guides/renderer-development.md) for details on implementing a renderer.

### Key requirements:

- Parse A2UI JSON messages, specifically the adjacency list format
- Map A2UI components to native widgets
- Handle data binding, lifecycle events
- Process a sequence of incremental A2UI messages to build and update the UI
- Support server initiated updates
- Support user actions

### Next Steps

- **[Client Setup Guide](../guides/client-setup.md)**: Integration instructions
- **[Quickstart](../quickstart.md)**: Try the Lit renderer
- **[Component Reference](components.md)**: What components to support
