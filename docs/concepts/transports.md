# Transports (Message Passing)

Transports deliver A2UI messages from agents to clients. A2UI is transport-agnostic—use any method that can send JSON.

The actual component rendering is done by the [renderer](../reference/renderers.md),
and the [agents](../reference/agents.md) are responsible for generating the A2UI messages.
Getting the messages from the agent to the client is the job of the transport.

## How It Works

```
Agent → Transport → Client Renderer
```

A2UI defines a sequence of JSON messages. The transport layer is responsible for delivering this sequence from the agent to the client. A common transport mechanism is a stream using a format like JSON Lines (JSONL), where each line is a single A2UI message.

## Available Transports

| Transport | Status | Use Case |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **A2A Protocol** | ✅ Stable | Multi-agent systems, enterprise meshes |
| **AG UI** | ✅ Stable | Full-stack React applications |
| **REST API** | 📋 Planned | Simple HTTP endpoints |
| **WebSockets** | 💡 Proposed | Real-time bidirectional |
| **SSE (Server-Sent Events)** | 💡 Proposed | Web streaming |

## A2A Protocol

The [Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org) provides secure,
standardized agent communication.  An A2A extension provides easy integration with A2UI.

**Benefits:**

- Security and authentication built-in
- Bindings for many message formats, auth, and transport protocols
- Clean separation of concerns

If you are using A2A, this should be nearly automatic.

**See:** [A2A Extension Specification](../specification/v0.8-a2a-extension.md)

## AG UI

[AG UI](https://ag-ui.com/) translates from A2UI messages to AG UI messages, and handles transport and state sync automatically.

If you are using AG UI, this should be automatic.

TODO: Add a detailed guide.

## Custom Transports

You can use any transport that sends JSON:

**HTTP/REST:**

```javascript
// TODO: Add an example
```

**WebSockets:**

```javascript
// TODO: Add an example
```

**Server-Sent Events:**

```javascript
// TODO: Add an example
```
