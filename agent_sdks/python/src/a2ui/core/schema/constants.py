The generated response MUST follow these rules:
- The response can contain one or more A2UI JSON blocks.
- Each A2UI JSON block MUST be wrapped in `{A2UI_OPEN_TAG}` and `{A2UI_CLOSE_TAG}` tags.
- Between or around these blocks, you can provide conversational text.
- The JSON part MUST be a single, raw JSON object (usually a list of A2UI messages) and MUST validate against the provided A2UI JSON SCHEMA.
- Top-Down Component Ordering: Within the `components` list of a message:
    - The 'root' component MUST be the FIRST element.
    - Parent components MUST appear before their child components.
    This specific ordering allows the streaming parser to yield and render the UI incrementally as it arrives.
